# What is Deep Learning?
is a branch of Machine Learning that focuses on using multi-layered artificial neural networks (Deep Neural Networks) to mimic how the human brain processes information and recognizes complex patterns.


# Features of Deep Learning:

 * It can learn complex representations directly from raw data (such as images, audio, text) without much human intervention in feature extraction.

 * Uses many layers (deep) of interconnected neurons that process information sequentially.

 * Applied in tasks like image recognition, machine translation, speech analysis, and autonomous driving.

## Deep Learning Algorithm:

1-Images and Videos:

 * Usually, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used because they are excellent at detecting patterns in images and videos.

 * Videos are considered sequences of images, so CNNs can be combined with temporal models to handle the time dimension.

2-Speech and Text:

 * For these, models that handle **sequential data** like Recurrent Neural Networks **(RNNs)**, especially LSTM, are used because they can manage long-term temporal relationships.

 * Also, Transformers have become very popular recently for analyzing text and speech.
