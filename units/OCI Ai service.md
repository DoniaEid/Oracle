   * It supports multiple languages and dialects (depending on configuration).

   * It can be used for things like meeting transcriptions, call logs, searchable audio archives, or even voice commands in applications.
Key features in OCI:

# What is demo vision?
  * A small showcase or test version of a vision-based AI solution.

  * Used to show capabilities like object detection, facial recognition, image classification, OCR (reading text from images), or scene understanding.

  * Could be interactive â€” for example, uploading an image and seeing how the AI labels it.

  * In the context of Oracle Cloud (OCI) or similar platforms, a "Demo Vision" might be:

  * A sample application that demonstrates OCI Vision service, which can classify images, detect objects, and extract text from images.

  * A quick start tool for developers to try the service without building a full production app
